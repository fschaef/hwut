# 'protocol.sh' of the Python demonstration; its producer is Go
# ('producer.go'), its GOOD files are Python's.
#
# Five clients talk to a service at once. The order of the lines is the
# scheduler's. 'protocol.pype' holds the LAW -- every request answered,
# once, before shutdown; nothing before its request; nothing after
# shutdown -- and prints one verdict per exchange, sorted. The producer
# reports as it happens and prints no '<hwut-end>': the pype's '<eof>'
# does (pype manual 1b).
#
# 'broken' feeds the same pype a stream that breaks the law on purpose --
# answered twice, never answered, an answer without its request, a request
# after shutdown. The pype names each breach and says 'law: BROKEN'; that
# report is the GOOD.
#
# 'slow' answers request 2 only after 3 s. The pype is fed LIVE, so its
# clock is the service's: 'tick:' wakes it while no line arrives, and a
# wait guard marks a request open for over 1 s as late. (A pype named in
# a header reads the output after the run, all at once -- time is no
# input there.)
